## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Update the `Card` model in `app/models.py` to include `meaning_upright`, `meaning_reversed`, `love_context_upright`, and `love_context_reversed`.
- [x] 1.2 Generate an Alembic migration (if Alembic is configured) or document that the tables need to be recreated to apply the schema change.
- [x] 1.3 Update or finalize `scripts/seed_cards.py` to successfully map the JSON data into the new schema.
